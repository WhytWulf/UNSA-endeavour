Suddenly you hear a strange screeching noise. Your first instinct is that it’s an alarm. 
Your hackles rise. How odd, and very out of place this alien sound, in such a peaceful setting.You see a sudden flap of wings above .A bird!

#SAY.IntroFLOWCHART.92.
With your remaining strength you hammer the button. 

For moment nothing appears to have happened, then you hear a click and a whir of an electical motor spinning up. 
A breeze of air blows across your face as the hermetic seal on the cylinder is broken, while the door continues to swing up and away from you.
